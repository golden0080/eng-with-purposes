# Engineering with Purposes

This is a personal repo, archiving engineering thoughts and ideas.

# What is engineering in Computer Science?

TODO(gh): expand on this section
It is prefixed with `engineer`, and naturally, engineering is around engineers.
It's about managing engineers, guiding them working as an trained organization, outputting products/tools/processes catering to various needs and requirements from Business and other sides.

Although engineering may not mainly determine `what` is a product or `who` will use it,
but it provide comprehensive narratives to `how` it will deliver and present itself ,
`how` does it work,
`when` will it be ready to use.

# What needs, requirements does it serve?

Engineering is the source of invention, serving nearly all parties in a business.

## Business requirements

The most important requirements engineering keeps serving in its lifespan. Meeting business requirements will provide precious opportunities for engineer team to grow, and engineering to evolve.

For this kind of requirements, engineering focuses are:

- Availability: users are able to use products.
- Scalability: products are able to serve a lot of users.
- Experience & Satisfaction: products offer modern, smooth and convenient experience to users during usage, providing satisfying solutions to users pain-points.
- Process & Practice alignment: products are aligned with dominant industry processes and practices. Changes in processes and practices are indicating changes in products.
- Security: businesses respect privacy and products should keep data and processes safe from hacking and sabotage.

## Operation requirements

The whole lifespan of a product is not only `build` and `use`.
With chains of logistics and customer service in mind, it would easily extend to `build`, `test`, `deliver`, `setup`, `use`, `support`.

Every step will require established processes in place and tools around them.

For operation needs, engineering focuses are:

- Availability: operators are able to use tools for their work.
- Scalability: tools should be able to scale to multiple operators.
- Process & Practice alignment: tools should be useful in operation processes.
- Efficiency: processes take time, and parallelism are to provide time efficiency.

## Software Development requirements

The bussiness is driven with software products, engineering is aiming to consistently produce quality softwares.

The focuses on software development needs:

- Reusability: code reusability. Modular design will benefits it.
- Efficiency: development efficiency. Necessary tooling is advised.
- Knowledge sharability: fluidity of knowledge among engineering team members. A critical score for maintainability of both code and organization.
- Consistency: the ability to produce consistent quality code.
- Testability: the ability to test code safely and efficiently. This should also include to A/B testing features.

## DevOps requirements

The software systems needs to be operated and maintained with expertise in computer systems and clusters.
DevOps, as vital part to system availability, tend to propose requirements from system levels:

- Observability: The ability to observe systems as black box, from outside. The relevant technologies include metrics, logging, instrumentation, tracing and dumping.
- Deployment Consistency: Keep it Simple and Stupid for deployment technologies, maintaining single stack of deployment stack is easier and less error-prone.
- Efficiency: Automation is the way to crystalize knowledge and corner stone for operation efficiency.
- Potential to prompt reaction: systems should be built with failsafes. Online feature switch is a good candidate for `the big red button` in emergencies.
