# Chapter 1. Engineering Quality In General

In this chapter, we will review general quality criterias for engineering. The quality of engineering may change in context of specific requirements, but they all share some of the core qualities mentioned in this chapter.

## Everyone talks about quality, but people rarely know about it

When people talk about quality, usually in a single point on the timeline. They will describe the good and bad so far, for their subjects.
So if you get quality descriptions on every point on the timeline, you can observe that not only qualities exists in one time, it has momentum, which is also the quality.

TODO(gh): how about justify the idea a bit?

So that quality is not only about good or bad at a given point, it's also the momentum, the moving energy across timeline. Thus, in this book, when we talk about quality, we are talk about qualities that maintains.

## How to describe engineering qualities, in general?

As for engineering qualities, we will focus on what it produces, how efficient does it produce and how maintainable the quality is.

When we talk about what does engineering produce in software industry, we are mainly talking about softwares, which is from code written by engineers. Code is the source of softwares, vice versa softwares are delivered code.

From the process to produce softwares, there are 2 steps: write and deliver code. 
And 2 entities, code and softwares.

The qualities in present terms lie in code and softwares (delivery factor) and how we code and deliver will be the qualities in future terms.

## Qualities in Present Terms

### Code, everything starts from here

Code are the souce of softwares, and good code not necessarily lead to good product and softwares, but it's a vital part to a product's success.

As good code can be described as:

- The code does what it is designed for.
- The code is well-structured.
- The code is mostly well-named.
- The code is adequately explained.
